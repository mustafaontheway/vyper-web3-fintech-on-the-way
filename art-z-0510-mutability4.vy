# Create an external nonpayable function named 'withdraw_funds' that takes a uint256 named 'amount' which allows an external user to withdraw a specified amount from 'contract_balance' if sufficient balance is available.
# This function should use 'assert' to check prior to decreasing 'amount' from 'contract_balance', else revert with 'Insufficient funds'.
